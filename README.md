**ACDC.digital is an artifical-intellegence research agency putting our adopted learning into practice to enable small businesses insights to advantages they wouldn't have known about otherwise.**

**Introduces:** 

![solomon-marker](assets/solomon-marker.svg)

Solomon is an intuitive machine learning model that is design to adapt artifical intellegence to the various needs of small businesses.   [1](#fn1) 

Solomon is quickly becoming more and more adaptable to natural business processes. Today, Solomon is now able to ingest large quantities of .pdf, and .txt files from a single directory. We can also analyze .csv files for financial purposes, and text sentiment analysis which enables Solomon to determine poignant examples of positive, neutral, and poor financial habits. These insights can be visualized in 2D and 3D charts, and the results can be used for further processing tasks such as database formulas for integrating this information with cross-departmental information to get further insight into the hollistic nature of the business.   [2](#fn2) 

Solomon version 3 now includes an engine module to serve embeddings without having to call the parallel processing file. Instead, the engine is now hard-coded into the module, and thus far, has proven significant results. Today's benchmarks include ingesting of 1,800+ pages and generating their text embeddings in under 3-minutes. This is our most impressive model engine, and proves to be an exciting of time of development as production days appear in the near future.   [4](#fn4)

Notes:

1.   I think there's a vision for Solomon, where there's a lab that hosts all of our artifical intellegence. Solomon is what the product is, but to branch out we need to have our own servers where we can build and implement applications from within our own laboratory. This is the most private way, and the easiest way to reduce overhead over the long -term. We want A100's in daisy-chain to operate our models, and provide a secure and dedicated cloud module for our customers. Or, alternatively, a self-hosted cloud environment for training and prototyping, then deliver finished products.
   
2.   Another concept that we need to keep in consideration, is that we need to continue to develop our internal server beyond the website tutorial. We need internal tools to evaluate user benchmarks with nice looking visuals. But more than that, we need a repository of information which will act as a gigantic reference library. We can combine this with our vectorstore and use cloud-hosting for easy access. Rather than create our own internal backend, it came to my attention we can use a Notion internalization, which could promote the development of certain parts of the site, and could integrate dashboards, etc. without the additional hassle of trying to learn everything within, React or Next.js. 

3.   In an extension of the notepad idea, I need to find a way to extend email access. How many emails can we write, draft, send per day? etc. How is this best integrated into our existing pipeline?

Executive Sumamary: Our project-app has been initiated via React and Next.js. We've created the User authentification with Clerk, and we've identified a potential integration with Supasbase (used for edge-functions related to user-data management). Following, we've created a Neon-db which is currently being used to hold the user-data collected from sign-in, document, and chat management. The back end of our application is written in Python, and covers a variety of essential Enterprise securities including complete Evaluation of digital tasks.

## Introduces MITP

The Solomon Architecture is based on advanced retrieval techniques, proprietary and developed by ACDC.digital in order to personalize assistant-based models for the company that they will be integrated with. This Architecture is called Machine Information Training & Personalization (MITP). The theoretical objective of our architecture is to determine how various inputs/modalities are interlinked in order to exploit those advantages for extremely personalized concepts that would not have been otherwise able to be discovered. 

The Solomon architecture takes advantage of many libraries in order to advance the skills of the model. Each skill currently has very refined code modules which act independently, and as solutions for integration arise, will be embedded into the master-model. Some features of our architecture include advanced visualizations from matplotlib, advanced sentiment analysis for text in both general documentation, but now including financial data. Other features include web-search, and market research capabilities. All branches of very poignant libraries in which more information can be found within our prospectus (link in the footnotes at the bottom).   [3](#fn3) 

The main architecture design uses traditional ml-techniques in combination with today's advanced artificial intellegence, to abstract and transform user data in such a way that vectorstorage is enabled. In this proces, we ingest large quantities of data, in multiple formats, which can then be further analyzed in advanced retrieval methods. In the front we use the React/Next.js libraries to develop user-friendly and information-forward web application. User Oauth and user-db are Supabase, along with a variety of other cool features. Our back-end is FastAPI for communicating with our model, then fine-tuned OpenAI models that are also trained on the retrieval-data. I believe this method will highly benefit the results as the database is able to scale. That is based on the information accumulated to date. We are betting this works better than we expect and cannot wait to see the results further down the line.
